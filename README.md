## 🧠 OOP Concepts Implemented

### **🔹 Encapsulation**

Employee data is secured using private fields and public getters/setters.

### **🔹 Inheritance**

`Manager` and `Developer` extend the base `Employee` class.

### **🔹 Polymorphism**

Each subclass overrides `showDetails()` with its own implementation.

### **🔹 Abstraction**

Users interact with simple methods without worrying about internal logic.
